# RFM Analysis in SQL and Visualization with Tableau
## Introduction
This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using SQL. The project aims to gain insights from customer data and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Furthermore, the project incorporates data visualization techniques using Tableau to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present the findings from the analysis.
## Technologies Used
- SQL: To query and analyze the customer data.
- Tableau: To create interactive and visually appealing visualizations and dashboards.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights:
The project addresses the following questions:

- Best Month for Sales: Determine the best month for sales in a specific year.
- Best Customer: Identify the best customer using RFM analysis.
- Frequently Sold Together: Discover which products are most often sold together.
- Highest Sales City: Determine the city with the highest number of sales in a specific country.
- Best Product in the United States: Find the best-selling product in the United States.
The project progresses from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. It leverages SQL queries, including subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), aggregate functions, and window functions. Additionally, Tableau is utilized for data visualization.
